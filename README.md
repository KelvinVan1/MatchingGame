# MatchingGame
Basic pygame based matching game I created when first learning python to learn how to create a cohesive program. Since then I have learned a ton and want to go back to this program and improve the code to look a lot cleaner.

# Features:
  1. GUI system to control the game
  2. The ability to change the order of the blocks falling by pressing SPACE
  3. Moving blocks left and right using the ARROW KEYS
  4. Game will close on loss. (Losing happens when the blocks reach the top)
  5. Blocks can be sped up by pressing the drop key (F)
